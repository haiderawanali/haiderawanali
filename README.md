## Hi, I’m Haider Ali 👋

Senior Software Architect | Backend & Distributed Systems Specialist | 15+ Years Experience

I design, modernize, and scale enterprise-grade backend systems used in fintech, SaaS, and regulated industries. My strength lies in architecture, reliability, and long-term maintainability rather than flashy demos.

This GitHub focuses on real-world backend engineering: clean architectures, system design patterns, and production-ready .NET solutions.

🔹 What I Specialize In

System Architecture & Modernization
  - Legacy .NET → Modern .NET (Clean Architecture, DDD, Modular Monoliths)
  - Microservices & event-driven systems (when they actually make sense)
    
Backend Engineering (Core Focus)
  - .NET / ASP.NET Core / Web APIs
  - High-performance data access (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
  - Background jobs, schedulers, patching & update systems

Distributed & Real-Time Systems
  - SignalR, messaging, async workflows
  - Client–server update orchestration
  - Fault tolerance & resilience patterns

Cloud & DevOps (Architecture-Level)
  - Azure (App Services, Functions, Storage, CI/CD)
  - Deployment strategies, rollback & zero-downtime updates

Engineering Leadership
  - Architecture reviews & risk assessments
  - Codebase audits & technical debt reduction
  - Mentoring teams on scalable design
