## Hi, I’m Haider Ali 👋

Senior Software Architect | Backend & Distributed Systems Specialist | 15+ Years Experience

I design, modernize, and scale enterprise-grade backend systems used in fintech, SaaS, and regulated industries. My strength lies in architecture, reliability, and long-term maintainability rather than flashy demos.

This GitHub focuses on real-world backend engineering: clean architectures, system design patterns, and production-ready .NET solutions.
